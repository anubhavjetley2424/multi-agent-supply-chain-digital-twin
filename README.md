🚚 Multi-Agent Supply Chain OS (Palantir Style) : Animal Medicine Manufacturer
Enterprise Agentic Layer for Logistics, Planning, and Finance
🌟 Executive Summary

Vetlab Autopak is a sophisticated Digital Twin and Agentic Operating System built to mirror and optimize complex supply chain lifecycles. Inspired by enterprise platforms like Palantir, it utilizes a multi-agent orchestration layer to monitor live logistics, automate financial reconciliation, and predict manufacturing risks through a "build-first" engineering approach.

🛠️ Technical Deep Dive
1. The Multi-Agent Brain (brain.py)
The orchestration layer coordinates four specialized agents using LangChain and GPT-4o:


Planner Agent: Cross-references inventory vs. production schedules to identify material mismatch risks.


Coordinator Agent: Monitors live shipments using Google Maps MCP for real-time ETA adjustments based on weather impacts.


Analyst Agent: Performs demand planning and aggregates orders into structured trends.


Finance Agent: Evaluates margin impacts of delays and logs commercial savings in Supabase.

2. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools
I developed professional-grade tools to give the agents "hands" in the real world:


Excel Manager: Autonomous generation of CSM Trackers and Pricing Packs featuring automated XLOOKUP reconciliation and charting.
+1


RAG Hub: Integrated Qdrant Vector DB allowing agents to query Supplier Contracts and SOPs for compliance checks.


HITL (Human-In-The-Loop): A critical safety layer where high-stakes commercial decisions (price hikes, customer alerts) require manual dashboard approval.

3. Data Engineering & Pipelines
To maintain a "Live" twin, the infrastructure leverages:


Kafka Stream Generator: Simulates high-concurrency IoT telemetry (truck temperature, engine load, weather).


Airflow Orchestration: Manages the batch-processing of manufacturing events, refreshing operational tables via GCP Cloud Composer.


Digital Twin Sync: A Next.js dashboard utilizing Deck.gl to render live shipment arcs and fragility indexes.
